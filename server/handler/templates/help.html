        <span>Bingo is a social game for many players.</span>
        <span>The game consists of a grand marshal and players.</span>
        <span>Before starting a game, players are given boards by the grand marshal.</span>
        <span>At each step in the game, the grand marshal draws a new number.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Numbers range from 1-75.</span>
        <span>They are also assigned Letters.</span>
        <span>The first fifteen (1-15) have the letter "B" and always appear in the first column on boards.</span>
        <span>The next for columns are assigned other letters of the word "bingo."</span>
        <span>Numbers 16-30 are assigned to "I", 31-45 to "N", 46-60 to "G", and 61-75 to "O."</span>
        <span>These letters can be used to quickly identify what column a number might be located on a board when it is called.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>If a player gets a full row, column, or diagonal with 5 numbers, he can call "BINGO".</span>
        <span>This is simply called a "line" bingo group.</span>
        <span>After a bingo is called, the grand marsh can check the board to determine if the player actually won or mistakenly called a "false" bingo.</span>
        <span>In the middle of each board, in the "N" column, there is a "free cell" that can be used by all players to form a bingo group.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>A game is usually over after a player has formed a bingo group.</span>
        <span>However, the game can continue until a player has all of their numbers called to form an "all-cell" bingo group.</span>
